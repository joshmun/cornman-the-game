## Description:
Created as a part of our Phase 3 Final Project at Dev Bootcamp - a 18 week Coding Immersive Bootcamp. This game was inspired by our cohortmate. Using Javascript with the Phaser.js framework we created an immersive side scroller game that allows users to Jump and Shoot enemies. The game is now deployed on Heroku for fun and mobile entertainment.
