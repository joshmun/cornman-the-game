# Contributing
### Basic Git Flow
1. Pull to update your local master
- Work in a branch
- Your work should happen in a series of small and concise commit messages. Basically, your solution shouldn't be a 1 gigantic commit.
- Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes on master
- Continuously push your branch to github.
- When you're done with your feature, interactive rebase and squash your commits as appropriate
- Force push your cleaned up branch to Github
- Submit a pull request to have your work reviewed and merged

##### Code Style
For the **final project**, you can choose your own code
style and pull-request workflow.

For the *group project*, use
- Styleguides
	- [AirBnB Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby)
	- [AirBnB JavaScript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- The code reviewer merges pull requests

### Pull Request Workflow
This workflow is required for the Group project.

### Pull Request Workflow
This workflow is required for the Group project.

**Make sure to set your git user and email so you get credit for your work**

1. Create a branch named for the feature you are working on
* Write Code
* Commit your code and write a [good commit message](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
* Push your branch and changes to your Github repository
* Create a Pull Request to your cohort organization

### Code Review Workflow

1. Another team mate reviews the pull request and writes code comments on Github
2. You make the desired changes (using the [Pull Request Workflow](#pull-request-workflow))
3. Repeat #1-2 until teammate has no more changes that need to be made
4. Merges must be communicated verbally when a PR is made and then merged in.

### Getting changes

You'll need to get changes that other pairs.  Use the `upstream` remote that we created earlier.

```
git pull upstream master
```
